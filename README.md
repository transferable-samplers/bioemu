# Biomolecular Emulator (BioEmu)

Biomolecular Emulator (BioEmu for short) is a model that samples from the approximated equilibrium distribution of structures for a protein monomer, given its amino acid sequence.

For more information, see our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.05.626885v1.abstract).

This repository contains inference code and model weights.

## Installation

We use git-LFS to store model weights. If you do not already have git-LFS installed, follow the instructions at https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/INSTALLING.md, e.g.
```
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

Run `setup.sh` to create a conda environment named 'bioemu' with bioemu and its dependencies installed.  `setup.sh` will install and patch [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold), create a conda environment called 'bioemu' with some installed dependencies that pip does not handle, and then pip-install the `bioemu` package inside the conda environment.

## Sampling structures
You can sample structures for a given protein sequence using the script `sample.py`:
```
python -m bioemu.sample --ckpt_path PATH/TO/CHECKPOINT \
                        --model_config_path PATH/TO/MODEL/CONFIG \
		        --denoiser_config_path PATH/TO/DENOISER/CONFIG \
		        --sequence SEQUENCE \
		        --num_samples NUM_SAMPLES \
		        --batch_size_100 BATCH_SIZE_100 \
		        --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR
```
You can omit some arguments if you want to use the default checkpoint and denoising settings. For example, to run a tiny test do:
```
python -m bioemu.sample --sequence GYDPETGTWG --num_samples 10 --output_dir ~/test-chignolin
```

Sampling times will depend on sequence length and available infrastructure. The following table gives times for collecting 1000 samples measured on an A100 GPU with 80 GB VRAM for sequences of different lengths (using a `batch_size_100=20` setting in `sample.py`):
 | sequence length | time / min |
 | --------------: | ---------: |
 |             100 |          4 |
 |             300 |         40 |
 |             600 |        150 |


## Reproducing results from the preprint
You can use this code together with code from [bioemu-benchmarks](https://github.com/microsoft/bioemu-benchmarks) to approximately reproduce results from our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.05.626885v1).

The `bioemu-v1.0` checkpoint contains the model weights used to produce the results in the preprint. Due to simplifications made in the embedding computation and a more efficient sampler, the results obtained with this code are not identical but consistent with the statistics shown in the preprint, i.e., mode coverage and free energy errors averaged over the proteins in a test set. Results for individual proteins may differ. For more details, please check the [BIOEMU_RESULTS.md](https://github.com/microsoft/bioemu-benchmarks/blob/main/bioemu_benchmarks/BIOEMU_RESULTS.md) document on the bioemu-benchmarks repository.

## Side-chain reconstruction and MD-relaxation
BioEmu outputs structures in backbone frame representation.
To reconstruct the side-chains, several tools are available. 
As an example, we provide a script to conduct side-chain reconstruction with HPacker (https://github.com/gvisani/hpacker), and provide an interface for running a short molecular dynamics (MD) equilibration.
HPacker is a method for protein side-chain packing based on holographic rotationally equivariant convolutional neural networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09312).

This code is experimental and is provided for research purposes only. Further testing/development are needed before considering its application in real-world scenarios or production environments.

### Install side-chain reconstruction tools
Clone and install the HPacker code and other dependencies with
```bash
./setup_sidechain_relax.sh
```

This will install some additional dependences for running MD relaxation in the `bioemu` environment. It will also install HPacker in a separate conda environment called `hpacker`.

### Use side-chain reconstruction tools
Inside the `bioemu` enviroment, run side-chain reconstruction with:
```bash
python -m bioemu.sidechain_relax --pdb-path path/to/topology.pdb --xtc-path path/to/samples.xtc
```
By default, side-chain reconstruction and local energy minimization are performed (no full MD integration for efficiency reasons).
Note that the runtime of this code scales with the size of the system.
We suggest running this code on a selection of samples rather than the full set.

There are two other options:
- To only run side-chain reconstruction without MD equilibration, add `--no-md-equil`.
- To run a short NVT equilibration (0.1 ns), add `--md-protocol nvt_equil`

To see the full list of options, call `python -m bioemu.sidechain_relax --help`.

The script saves reconstructed all-heavy-atom structures in `samples_sidechain_rec.{pdb,xtc}` and MD-equilibrated structures in `samples_md_equil.{pdb,xtc}` (filename to be altered with `--outname other_name`).

## Third-party code
The code in the `openfold` subdirectory is copied from [openfold](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold) with minor modifications. The modifications are described in the relevant source files.
